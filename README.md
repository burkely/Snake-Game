# Snake-Game
My first shot at creating a game with code!

Have the basic snake game functions: 
- Snake turns and body follows and also turns on the same spot. 
- 'Food' blocks randomly placed on the plane.
- 'Eating' a food (colliding with it) makes the snake one unit length longer. 
  - Only eats the food if the front facing side of the head collides with the food.
  
To Implement:
- Almost done with collision checks (for walls)
- also going to implement Euclidean 2-torus (donut loop/wraparound) for higher levels
- display score
- different types of food
- difficulty levels
